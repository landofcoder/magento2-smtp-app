# Magento 2 SMTP Extension - Gmail, G Suite, Amazon SES, Office360, Mailgun, SendGrid, Mandrill and other SMTP servers.


##### For Magento 2.0.x, 2.1.x, 2.2.x and 2.3.x

Configure Magento 2 to send all transactional email using Google App, Gmail, Amazon Simple Email Service (SES), Microsoft Office365 or any other SMTP servers. 

Sending transactional emails to customers is a vital part of running an e-commerce store. Our free custom Magento extension integrates with all major email service provider and third-party SMTP server to reliably deliver messages in customers' inbox.

#### What is SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
SMTP or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol allows you to send emails from your Magento 2 store through a specific third-party mail SMTP server. For example, if you want to use your Gmail, Amazon, Microsoft or any other mail server account to send email from your Magento web store, all you need is to configure that mail server setting in our extension in Magento without having to do any complex server configuration.



#### Why use a Custom SMTP Server with Magento

By default, most hosting companies mail servers are configured to send email from unauthorized senders which prevent emails from reliable delivered to recipients. Therefore, most Magento store owners struggle to limit the number of transactional emails that end up in clients' junk mail. Take full control of your email sending settings in Magento 2 and reduce sending email to your valuable customers' junk mail folder. Emails are delivered instantaneously to their intended recipients without delays or get trap in the spam folder.

Out of the box, Magento 2 doesn't provide the ability to specify your custom SMTP settings for outgoing emails using an external SMTP server. Using this extension bridges the gap and allows your Magento store to connect to your preferred email provider securely and easily.

All you need is either an (i) free Gmail account, (ii) paid Google Apps account or any other SMTP service (i.e Amazon Simple Email Service / Amazon SES, Microsoft Office365).

### Benefits of using Gmail SMTP
Since Google's, Gmail and G Suite SMTP server does not use Port 25, you'll reduce the probability that an ISP might block your email or flag it as SPAM. Also, all your emails sent from Magento will be searchable and backed-up in your email account on Google's servers.
